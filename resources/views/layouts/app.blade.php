{{--
    The base layout.

    This is the 2024 site's own shell, rebuilt on the template's class names so
    the stylesheet in assets/css/style.css applies as written. Three things here
    are load-bearing rather than cosmetic:

    1. `dir` and `lang` come from the resolved Locale, not from a hardcoded
       string, and `rtl` is put on <body> as well because the template's own
       RTL rules are all scoped to `.rtl` rather than to `[dir=rtl]`. Getting
       either wrong leaves a page that reads left-to-right with the text ordered
       right-to-left, which is the exact failure the brief asks to avoid.

    2. The language switcher posts the current URL back to the server rather
       than guessing a counterpart path in JavaScript, so switching works with
       scripting disabled and the resulting URL is real.

    3. The stylesheets are linked from /assets rather than compiled by Vite.
       Bootstrap 5's reboot and Tailwind's preflight both reset the same
       properties, and loading both makes the rendered result depend on which
       stylesheet wins a tie — which is not a thing worth discovering in a
       browser. The template is the design; nothing else competes with it.

    {{-- The three language variants are the same page, and the default language —
         Arabic — is the unprefixed, canonical one.

         The alternates are generated from the current route's canonical name
         rather than from url()->current(), because the current URL is by
         definition the wrong language for two of the three entries. The `.ar`
         suffix is stripped: it is there only to keep route:list readable, and
         passing it to route() would ask for a URL that does not exist.

         The default language's alternate has to name the *unprefixed* route
         explicitly. `route('contact', ['locale' => 'ar'])` would emit
         /ar/contact, which is not an address on this site — and worse, on a
         prefixed page `URL::defaults()` would win over an empty value and
         produce /fr/contact, i.e. the hreflang would claim the French page is
         the Arabic one. Naming the unprefixed route sidesteps both.

         Skipped on POST, where there is no GET address for the page and a
         referer-derived URL would be a guess. --}}

        Web fonts.

        Cairo for Arabic, Inter for Latin. Cairo is loaded rather than one of
        the bundled faces because the bundled Arabic faces are licensed for
        display use and are weak below 20px: at body size their stroke weight
        gives way and a paragraph reads as grey. Cairo was designed for exactly
        this range. AvenirArabic and THESANSARABIC stay in the stack as local
        fallbacks, so the page is still readable if the CDN is blocked — which
        matters on a slow connection, not only an offline one.

        Only the Arabic face is requested on Arabic pages and only the Latin
        face on Latin pages. Requesting both on every page would be ~60KB of
        font the page cannot use, blocking first paint for an Arabic visitor.

        `display=swap` means text paints immediately in the fallback and swaps
        when the face arrives, rather than showing an invisible page for the
        length of the request.

         layer that decides how the site looks. It goes last so its tokens and

         anywhere — which is what makes the site restyle from one file, and what
