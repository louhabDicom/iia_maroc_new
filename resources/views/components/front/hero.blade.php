{{--
    The front-office hero.

    One band, used by every public page, and the same band the landing page
    opens with — same background, same brand pattern, same three marks, same
    bloom and sparks, same type scale. The page's own title is the only thing
    that differs.

    That is the point. A reader who lands on the programme from a search result
    and one who arrived from the landing page should not be able to tell from
    the first screen whether they are on the same site: the hero is the site's
    signature, and a second, quieter hero on the inner pages reads as a
    different website with a shared footer.

    It reuses the `h-hero` classes rather than defining `f-hero` ones. The
    landing page's markup is `components/home/hero.blade.php`, which is left
    exactly as it is — this is the same design expressed as a reusable
    component, not a second implementation of it.

    The three facts (when, where, which city) are the ones a delegate checks
    before anything else, and they come from the edition rather than from the
    page, so they read identically everywhere.

    Props are all optional: a page with nothing to say in the lede simply omits
    it rather than passing an empty string, and the band closes up.
