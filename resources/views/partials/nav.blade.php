{{--
    Primary navigation, rendered twice from one list.

    `variant` decides the element and the classes, nothing else: "bar" is the
    inline row in the header, "drawer" is the same links stacked in the mobile
    panel. Both render from the list below, so the two can never drift apart —
    which is the whole failure mode of a template with a separate hardcoded
    mobile menu, and the reason the 2024 build's phone menu had lost a link.

    Active state comes from `request()->routeIs()`, which asks the router which
    named route actually matched. The 2024 build searched REQUEST_URI for each
    page's own filename; that cannot work here, because this app has two URLs
    per page (`/programme` and `/fr/programme`), and a substring test marks the
    wrong item on both.

    `aria-current="page"` rides alongside the class so the highlight survives a
    high-contrast mode and is announced by a screen reader — the class alone
    carries no meaning to either.
