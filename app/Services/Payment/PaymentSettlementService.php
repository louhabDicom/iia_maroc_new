/**
 * Applies a verified gateway result to an order.
 *
 * This is the class the 2024 build most conspicuously lacked. It had a
 * `callback.php` that wrote to `iia_condidat` — a table the conference flow
 * never populated — so a customer could pay 7 500 MAD and the order stayed
 * 'encours' forever, invisible to the organiser and blocking the customer from
 * trying again.
 *
 * Three properties make the difference:
 *
 *  1. **Idempotency.** The gateway may call back more than once; CMI's own
 *     documentation says a rejection can be followed by an acceptance for the
 *     same order. A unique `idempotency_key` makes the second call a no-op
 *     rather than a second capture.
 *  2. **The state machine is enforced.** `transitionTo()` refuses an illegal
 *     move, so a late callback cannot flip a cancelled order back to paid.
 *  3. **Only a verified payload gets here.** The controller verifies the
 *     signature before calling; this class never sees unverified input.
