/**
 * Enrolment and checking for an authenticator app (TOTP, RFC 6238).
 *
 * The shape of the flow, and why it is two steps:
 *
 *   1. `begin()` writes a *pending* secret and returns it. The account cannot use
 *      it yet, because the visitor has not proved they stored it.
 *   2. `confirm()` checks a code against that secret and, only on success, sets
 *      `totp_confirmed_at` and mints the recovery codes.
 *
 * Splitting them is what makes enrolment survivable. A single step — write the
 * secret and mark it usable — leaves an account whose secret lives only on a
 * phone that was already lost when the QR was scanned. Here, failing at step 2
 * costs a rescan and nothing else.
 *
 * The secret is encrypted at rest by the `encrypted` cast on the model, so it is
 * only ever plain text in memory here, inside this class. It is never logged.
