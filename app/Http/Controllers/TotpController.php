/**
 * Enrolling an authenticator app, and proving it works.
 *
 * Replaces the SMS verification flow. The shape is the two-step idea the service
 * describes — issue a secret, then prove the visitor kept it — but the proof is a
 * code their own phone computes rather than one a gateway sends.
 *
 * Reachable while authenticated but not yet enrolled, which is the whole point:
 * a half-finished registration has to be resumable. The page is behind `auth`,
 * never behind the enrolment gate, or it would be unreachable by exactly the
 * accounts that need it.
 *
 * Nothing here reads an identifier from the request. The account is whatever
 * `$request->user()` is, and the secret it is checked against is the one already
 * on that account.
