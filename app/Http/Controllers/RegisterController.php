/**
 * Account creation, gated by an authenticator app.
 *
 * The shape of the flow is the important part:
 *
 *   1. POST /register  -> the account is created and the visitor is signed in
 *                         immediately, but `totp_confirmed_at` stays null.
 *   2. POST /totp/setup -> they scan a QR code, prove it works, and the number
 *                         of an authenticator they hold is on the account.
 *
 * Signing the person in at step 1 rather than after step 2 is deliberate: a
 * half-finished registration should be resumable, and forcing them to re-enter
 * the form after a failed code would be a support burden for no security gain,
 * because {@see EnsureTotpIsConfirmed} already blocks
 * ordering until enrolment is finished.
 *
 * What is *not* deliberate is reading the phone number from the request and
 * trusting it as proof of anything. It is stored as contact data and nothing
 * more; the number on the account is never evidence that the person owns it.
