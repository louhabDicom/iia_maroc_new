/**
 * The signed-in delegate's own area.
 *
 * Deliberately thin: profile editing, the verification state and the order
 * history. The registration, order and payment work all happens elsewhere, and
 * every action here is scoped through a route model binding or `$request->user()`
 * rather than an id from the request, because the 2024 build trusted `$_GET`
 * user ids and let any visitor read any participant's order.
 *
 * The two write actions take the account from `$request->user()` and never from
 * the request body. There is no `user_id` field on either form, so there is
 * nothing for a caller to tamper with.
