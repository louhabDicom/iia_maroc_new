/**
 * The payment endpoints.
 *
 * Three separate requests arrive here and they are not interchangeable:
 *
 *   - `callback`  CMI, server to server. Authoritative. The only path that
 *                 settles an order. No session and no CSRF token: it answers
 *                 with CMI's own protocol words, not HTML.
 *   - `return`    CMI, through the customer's browser. A courtesy. It records
 *                 what it can but never settles: the customer can close the
 *                 tab before it fires and the URL is trivially forgeable.
 *   - `cancel`    The customer gave up. Nothing is settled, nothing guessed.
 *
 * The 2024 build had `Ok-Fail.php` settling from the browser return and
 * `callback.php` writing to a table nobody populated, so a paid order never
 * became paid. Getting this division right is the single most important
 * correctness fix in the port.
