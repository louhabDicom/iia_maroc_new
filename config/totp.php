| How a delegate proves they can get back into their own account, replacing the
| SMS code that asked them to prove a phone number.
|
| The practical difference is cost: an SMS per verification is metered by a
| provider, and this is arithmetic on a shared secret with no per-message charge
| and no third party in the loop. The price is friction — a phone without an
| authenticator app cannot use this, and a delegate who changes handset loses
| their codes unless they saved the recovery set. That trade is stated out loud
| on the enrolment page rather than discovered afterwards.
|
| `required` decides whether an account without a confirmed secret can order. It
| is on: an unconfirmed account is the same state the 2024 build left every
| account in, which is the gap this whole feature exists to close.
