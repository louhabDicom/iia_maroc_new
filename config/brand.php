    | version and is markedly wider than the Latin ones because it carries the
    | dates and the location; English and French are the second and third
    | versions of the same lockup. Each language therefore gets its own correct
    | artwork rather than the Arabic file being reused everywhere.
    |
    | Intrinsic dimensions travel with the path so the markup can declare
    | width/height and reserve the right box before the PNG arrives. The Arabic
    | lockup is roughly three times as wide as the Latin pair, so a single
    | hard-coded size would be wrong for two of the three locales.

    |
    | Each entry carries its own label rather than the template inventing one:
    | the mark is a glyph, and a glyph is not a name. `icon` names a Font
    | Awesome 6 class; `image` is for the one channel whose mark is not in the
    | icon font, and takes precedence when both are given.
    |
    | `label` is deliberately not translated. These are the platforms' own
    | names, which are not rendered in Arabic or French on the platforms
    | themselves either — translating them produces "Facebook" as a word nobody
    | searching for the page would type.
