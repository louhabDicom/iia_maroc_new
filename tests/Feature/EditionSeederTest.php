/**
 * The seeded 2026 edition must match the brief.
 *
 * Prices are the reason this file exists. They were wrong in the first draft
 * (6 375 / 7 500 MAD and 675 / 850 USD) because a member rate had been invented
 * as "85% of standard" on top of a standard price that was itself read from the
 * wrong column of the brief. Nothing caught it: the seeder ran clean, the
 * pricing page rendered, and the number was simply wrong on a page whose whole
 * job is to state the number.
 *
 * The authoritative source is sheet "Modifications 2026", row 15:
 *
 *     C15  7 500/8 500 MAD et 750/850 EUR     (2024: EUR)
 *     D15  7 500/8 500 MAD et 750/850 USD     (2026 target)
 *
 * The lower figure is the IIA member rate, the higher is standard.
